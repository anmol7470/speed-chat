- Use latest library features.
- Use bun as package manager.
- Use shadcn/ui as component library. Install components using `bun run shadcn-add <component>`.
- Queries should use `useQueryWithStatus` from `@/lib/utils` instead of `useQuery` from `convex/react`. It's wrapper for `useQuery` from `convex/react` and exports: isPending, isError, data, error, isLoading, isSuccess for each query.
- Mutations from convex should use `useMutation` from `convex/react` and be wrapped in try-catch blocks.
- Use `toast` from `react-hot-toast` for all toast notifications.
- Use Image from `next/image` for all images.
- Use Link from `next/link` for app links and `<a>` for external links.
- Break down complex components into smaller components.
- Use kebab-case naming convention for file names.
- Use Lucide React for icons.
- Use `cn` from `@/lib/utils` for all class name merging.
- Never create markdown files (`.md`) after you are done. Never!
- Never cast to any type. Always use correct types.
